## What actually is terminal?
I remember starting out and hearing people say they used Zsh, Fish, or Bash which are text based and then, someone would mention Kitty, Alacritty, and I’d be confused because these apps have graphical interface while the others are just text. **So, what actually is a terminal?** 

It is a text-based interface where a terminal emulator displays the input/output and a shell executes the commands.

The shells like Zsh and Fish are the command environments, while the terminal emulator is the GUI app (like Kitty) that hosts them. Essentially, what we call a 'terminal' is the combination of the two: the emulator provides the window, and the shell provides the logic

## Ok now which terminal emulator should I use?
Kitty is one of my favourite and is configurable. If you are on omarchy just enable kitty by following the steps.

1. Click SUPER (windows_key) + ALT + SPACE
2. Then click on install and then click on terminal
3. On the option Kitty install click ENTER

on any other arch based distro type the following command in default terminal
```bash
sudo pacman -S kitty
```
we will cover the above command in an upcoming tutorial about package management.

## I have setup my terminal emulator now which shell I should use?
Use bash its great, when using A.I agents during coding they use bash scripts frequently. Also you can easily run bash scripts which have problem with other shells like fish. Also in containers, cloud you will almost always use bash.

Next jump on `linux/terminal_logistics.md` were will look on basic commands to navigate the terminal or take a break and then come back tomorow.

## HAPPY NAVIGATION!
