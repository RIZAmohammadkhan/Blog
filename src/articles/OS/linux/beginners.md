## Why Linux?

Linux is the engine of the modern world. It breathes life into modest hardware, powers the global cloud, and serves as the backbone of containerization. Beyond its utility, Linux offers total customizability. If you want to truly understand how computers work—from how programs are installed to how systems are architected—Linux is the gold standard. It’s more than an OS; it’s a way to experience true digital freedom.

## I’m new to development and afraid of deleting Windows.

Growth usually lives just outside your comfort zone. It’s natural to feel hesitant about leaving a familiar environment, but **trust the process**: the transition will pay off tenfold in your career. If you aren't ready to go "all in," you can always start with a dual-boot setup or a Virtual Machine, but the real magic happens when you make Linux your daily driver.

## Why are there so many distros? (It feels overwhelming!)

At its heart, every Linux distribution shares the same kernel. The primary differences lie in the **package management**—how you install and update software.

* **Debian-based** (like Ubuntu) uses `apt`.
* **Fedora-based** uses `dnf` (RPM).
* **Arch-based** uses `pacman`.

## Which distro should I choose?

If you are an absolute beginner, I recommend **EndeavourOS**. It provides a clean, bloat-free experience that feels familiar to Windows users while introducing you to the power of the Arch ecosystem. You’ll only need to learn `pacman` and `yay` for package management. While many suggest Ubuntu, it often comes with "bloat" and unnecessary GUI tools that hide how Linux actually works.

If you trust your ability to learn quickly, try **Omarchy**. It’s a powerhouse for developers. Once you master the Omarchy and Hyprland keybindings, your workflow will reach a level of efficiency you never thought possible.

## How to install linux?

Installing linux is a same process for any distro you have to follow the steps:
1. Download the `.iso` image
2. Create a bootable USB
3. Boot in BIOS
4. Boot from bootable drive
5. Follow standard installation steps 

Since now we are ready with linux our next step would be navigate the terminal,The core of linux. Check out `linux/terminal.md` for next step or enjoy a cup of coffee.

## HAPPY TINKERING!
