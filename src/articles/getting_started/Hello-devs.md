## What is this Guide?
This guide is a written version of my own experience while learning to develop. It covers the tools you should use and the paths that actually make sense when you’re starting out. Every tool mentioned here is something I’ve personally used, broken, fixed, and learned from so nothing is theoretical or random.
In this guide first I will tell you **WHY?** then **HOW**.

## Who is this Guide for?
This guide is for anyone who wants to learn about dev tooling **efficiently**. Whether you’re a complete beginner, a student from a non-CS background looking to transition (yes, even metallurgy) or just someone curious about how things work, there’s something here for you.

## Why write a guide when people can ask AI?
Asking AI already requires some knowledge about the topic. If you don’t know that you can build efficient web apps in Rust, whenever you ask AI to build a web app it will most likely suggest React, Next.js, etc.

Also, getting a person’s real personal experience through AI isn’t really possible. It usually gives generic answers unless your prompt is extremely specific. 


I wanted to share my entire journey the tools I use, the mistakes I made, and what actually worked for me.


## How to use this Guide
I recommend starting from the `OS` folder and working your way through the articles. Each article ends by telling you what to read next, so you can move forward step by step without confusion.

That said, you don’t **have** to read everything in order. Each article is written to be self-sufficient, so you can jump to any topic that interests you without feeling lost.

## Do I use AI while writing this guide?
I only use AI to fix grammatical mistakes. Every tool and thought mentioned in this guide entirely my own.

## HAPPY TINKERING!
