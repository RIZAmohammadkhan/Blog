## What is this Guide?
This guide is a written version of my own experience while learning to engineer. It covers the tools you should use and the paths that actually make sense when you’re starting out. Every tool mentioned here is something I’ve personally used, broken, fixed, and learned from so nothing is theoretical or random.
In this guide first I will tell you **WHY?** then **HOW**.

## Who is this Guide for?
This guide is for anyone who wants to learn about dev tooling **efficiently**. Whether you’re a complete beginner, a student from a non-CS background looking to transition (yes, even metallurgy) or just someone curious about how things work, there’s something here for you.

## How to use this Guide
I recommend starting from the `OS` folder and working your way through the articles. Each article ends by telling you what to read next, so you can move forward step by step without confusion.

That said, you don’t **have** to read everything in order. Each article is written to be self-sufficient, so you can jump to any topic that interests you without feeling lost.

## HAPPY TINKERING!
