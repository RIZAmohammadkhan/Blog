## The Shipping Mindset

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut project = Project::new();
    
    loop {
        project.ship_small_iteration();
        project.gather_feedback();
        project.improve();
        
        if project.is_complete() {
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

Shipping is a muscle. The more you exercise it, the stronger it gets.

## Why Shipping Matters

1. **Feedback loops** - You learn what works
2. **Momentum** - Small wins build confidence
3. **Visibility** - People see your progress
4. **Learning** - Real users reveal real problems

## How to Start

- Set weekly shipping goals
- Break big projects into tiny milestones
- Celebrate every deploy
- Learn from what doesn't work
