## What I'd Tell My Past Self

After years of writing code, reviewing pull requests, and mentoring junior developers, I've distilled my advice into this playbook. If you're just starting out, this is for you.

## 1. Build a Habit of Shipping

The difference between developers who grow fast and those who plateau is simple: shipping frequency.

```javascript
// Bad: Perfectionism paralysis
function optimizeForMonths() {
  // Never ships
}

// Good: Ship, learn, iterate
function shipAndIterate() {
  // Version 1 goes live
  // Feedback comes in
  // Version 2 improves
}
```

## 2. Read Code More Than You Write It

The best developers are code archaeologists. They dig into libraries, frameworks, and senior developers' code to understand patterns.

## 3. Embrace the Uncomfortable

If you're not slightly confused daily, you're not growing. Comfort zones are where skills go to die.

## 4. Document Your Learning

Start a blog. Write READMEs. Comment your code. Teaching is the best way to learn.

## 5. Find Your Community

Join Discord servers. Attend meetups. Contribute to open source. Coding alone is hard; coding with support is sustainable.

*Remember: Every senior developer was once where you are now. Keep shipping.*
